# Custom Adminer Package with dark theme

### Text from the creator (I just forked and add localhost support)
It's an adminer theme with very clean look and you can add your own logo. We have made it for using at @authlab

### Why You use this adminer:
This is adminer with a black theme, If you work with WordPress and you have to manage databases then this is for you.
This theme was made by an organization named AuthLab. I forked and just added some code to support for local server run by xampp, Wamp, Mamp, etc.
So it should work perfectly on any local server.

### How to use:
1. Just clone or download this on your project folder.
2. Then rename this folder as adminer

If you have a localhost server then browse:
localhost/adminer

If you have a server like Laravel Valet then browse:
adminer.test or adminer.dev
like your WordPress
Then You can see a login window of your MySql like this picture bellow. Login with your password and enjoy.


N.B: For development purposes, I ignored password protection so you can log in with the user: root and password will be empty.
You can add password support by editing file index.php and replace the `credentials` method with `return ['localhost', 'root', 'root'];`
and login method with `return ($login == 'root' && $password == 'root');`
